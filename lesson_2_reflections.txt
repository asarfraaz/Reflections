1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Ans : When we initialize a repository, a .git directory is created
		that contains the meta-data for all the files in the
		repository. This meta-data is used by Git
	      We need to initialize a repository to tell Git, which set of
	      files or directories we want it to keep track of
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
   repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Ans : Staging area contains all the files from the working directory
		that we want to be added to the repository.
		We can use this as a temporary location before actually adding
		the new files to the repository

		I am really not sure what value the staging area offers
