1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
   work local?
Ans : When working from multiple machines, locations, or when someone else has
      access to add or modify data to my repository

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
   automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans : I would not want to overwrite changes from remote onto my local changes
      Unless, my local repository is only a read-only repository, I would not
      like to automatically update with my remote repository
